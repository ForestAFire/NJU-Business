# 排队服务

here are 2 servers available to process n jobs. Initially, each server begins work on a job. Whenever a server completes work on a job, that job leaves the system and the server begins processing a new job(provided there are still jobs waiting to be processed). Let T denote the time until all jobs have been processed. If the time that it takes server i to process a job is exponentially distributed with rate ![img](2020 随机过程 试卷回忆.assets/clip_image002.gif), find E[T] and var(T).



Consider a two-server parallel queuing system where customers arrive according to a Poisson process with rate ![img](2020 随机过程 试卷回忆.assets/clip_image002-1640843130007.gif), and where the service times are exponential with rate ![img](2020 随机过程 试卷回忆.assets/clip_image004-1640843130007.gif). Moreover, suppose that arrivals finding both servers busy immediately depart without receiving any service (such a customer is said to be lost), whereas those finding at least one free server immediately enter service and then depart when their service is completed.

(a) If both servers are presently busy, find the expected time until the next customer enters the system.

(b) Starting empty, find the expected time until both servers are busy.

(c) Find the expected time between two successive lost customers.

# 好年坏年{每年都考}

In good years, storms occur according to a Poisson process with rate 3 per unit time, while in other years they occur according to a Poison process with rate 5 per unit time. Suppose next year will be a good year with probability 0.3. Let N(t) denote the number of storms during the first t time units of next year.

(a) Find P{N(t) =n}

b) Is {N(t)} a Poisson process?

c) Does {N(t)} have stationary increments? Why or why not?

(d) Does it have independent increments? Why or why not?

(e) If next year starts off with three storms by time t = 1, what is the conditional probability it is a good year?

 Consider two machines, both of which have an exponential lifetime with mean ![img](2020 随机过程 试卷回忆.assets/clip_image002-1640843202528.gif). There is a single repairman that can                service machines at an exponential rate ![img](2020 随机过程 试卷回忆.assets/clip_image004-1640843202528.gif). Set up the Kolmogorov backward equations; you need not solve them.
