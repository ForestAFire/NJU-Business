第一题为第3版课本第九章例题，分别计算组合前和组合后的VaR和ES：以下为解答

A bank has two $10 million one-year loans. The probabilities of default are as indicated
in the following table.

| Outcome                                  | Probability |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Neither loan defaults                    | 97.50%      |
| Loan 1 defaults; Loan 2 does not default | 1.25%       |
| Loan 2 defaults; Loan 1 does not default | 1.25%       |
| Both loans default                       | 0.00%       |

If a default occurs, all losses between 0% and 100% of the principal are equally likely. If the loan does not default, a profit of \$0.2 million is made.

Consider first Loan 1. This has a 1.25% chance of defaulting. When a default occurs the loss experienced is evenly distributed between zero and \$10 million. This means that there is a 1.25% chance that a loss greater than zero will be incurred; there is a 0.625% chance that a loss greater than \$5 million is incurred; there is no chance of a loss greater than \$10 million. The loss level that has a probability of 1% of being exceeded is \$2 million. (Conditional on a loss being made, there is an 80% or 0.8 chance that the loss will be greater than \$2 million. Because the probability of a loss
is 1.25% or 0.0125, the unconditional probability of a loss greater than \$2 million
is 0.8 × 0.0125 = 0.01 or 1%.) The one-year 99% VaR is therefore \$2 million. The same applies to Loan 2. 

Consider next a portfolio of the two loans. There is a 2.5% probability that a default will occur. As before, the loss experienced on a defaulting loan is evenly distributed between zero and \$10 million. The VaR in this case turns out to be \$5.8 million. This is because there is a 2.5% (0.025) chance of one of the loans defaulting and conditional on this event is a 40% (0.4) chance that the loss on the loan that defaults is greater than \$6 million. The unconditional probability of a loss from a default being greater than \$6 million is therefore 0.4 × 0.025 = 0.01 or 1%. In the event that one loan defaults, a profit of \$0.2 million is made on the other loan, showing that the one-year 99% VaR is \$5.8 million.

We showed that the VaR for a single loan is \$2 million. The ES from a single loan when the time horizon is one year and the confidence level is 99% is therefore the expected loss on the loan conditional on a loss greater than \$2 million. Given that losses are uniformly distributed between zero and \$10 million, the expected loss conditional on a loss greater than \$2 million is halfway between \$2 million and \$10 million, or \$6 million. 

The VaR for a portfolio consisting of the two loans was calculated in Example 9.6 as \$5.8 million. The ES from the portfolio is therefore the expected loss on the portfolio conditional on the loss being greater than \$5.8 million. When one loan defaults, the other (by assumption) does not and outcomes are uniformly distributed between a gain of \$0.2 million and a loss of \$9.8 million. The expected loss, given that we are in the part of the distribution between \$5.8 million and \$9.8 million, is \$7.8 million. This is therefore the ES of the portfolio.

第二题为第3版第11章课后习题：解答如下：

**11.16** Suppose that the price of Asset X at close of trading yesterday was \$300 and its volatility was estimated as 1.3% per day. The price of X at the close of trading today is \$298. Suppose further that the price of Asset Y at the close of trading yesterday was \$8, its volatility was estimated as 1.5% per day, and its correlation with X was estimated as 0.8. The price of Y at the close of trading today is unchanged at \$8. Update the volatility of X and Y and the correlation between X and Y using
$$
x_{n-1} = \frac{X_{n-1} - X_{n-2}}{X_{n-2}} = -0.00667 , \sigma_{x,n-1} = 0.013,\\
y_{n-1} = \frac{Y_{n-1} - Y_{n-2}}{Y_{n-2}} = 0, \sigma_{y,n-1} = 0.015,\\
\rho_{n-1} = 0.8 \Rightarrow cov_{n-1} = \rho_{n-1} \times \sigma_{x,n-1} \times \sigma_{y,n-1} = 0.000156
$$
(a) The EWMA model with $\lambda= 0.94$
$$
\sigma_{x,n}^2 = \lambda \sigma_{x,n-1}^2 + (1-\lambda) x_{n-1}^2 = 0.00016153\Rightarrow \sigma_{x,n} = 0.01271\\
\sigma_{y,n}^2 = \lambda \sigma_{y,n-1}^2 + (1-\lambda) y_{n-1}^2 = 0.0002115\Rightarrow \sigma_{y,n} = 0.01454\\
cov_{n} = \lambda cov_{n-1} + (1-\lambda) x_{n-1}y_{n-1} = 0.00014664 \\
\Rightarrow \rho_{n} = \frac{cov_n}{\sigma_{x,n}\sigma_{y,n}} = 0.7934
$$
(b) The GARCH(1,1) model with $\omega= 0.000002, \alpha= 0.04, \beta= 0.94$.
In practice, is the $\omega$ parameter likely to be the same for X and Y?
$$
\sigma_{x,n}^2 = \omega + \alpha x_{n-1}^2 + \beta \sigma_{x,n-1}^2 = 0.0001624 \Rightarrow \sigma_{x,n} = 0.01275\\
\sigma_{y,n}^2 = \omega + \alpha y_{n-1}^2 + \beta \sigma_{y,n-1}^2 = 0.0002135 \Rightarrow \sigma_{y,n} = 0.01461\\
cov_n = \omega + \alpha x_{n-1}y_{n-1} + \beta cov_{n-1} = 0.00014864 \\
\Rightarrow \rho_n = \frac{cov_n}{\sigma_{x,n}\sigma_{y,n}} = 0.07977
$$

第五题为论文：讨论CEO的一篇论文，我觉得lds说的每道题两三个单词解决不现实。要注意论文的批注。

比如我们这次考试涉及了乔布斯和Tim Cook谁经历的风险更大，不看注释可能就不会注意。
